Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been widely applied to the automated detection of pipeline leaks. However, traditional AI methods still face significant challenges in effectively de-tecting the complete leak process. Furthermore, the deployment cost of such models has increased substantially due to the use of GPU-trained neural networks in recent years. In this study, we propose a novel leak detection model along with an improved sequence labeling method for leak detection. The proposed model combines the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with an Au-toencoder (AE): first, a Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TKAN) is employed to capture the complex temporal dependencies in the data, and then an Autoencoder is used to compress and reconstruct the input data, ultimately calculating the reconstruction loss. To better identify leaks, we have developed a new sequence labeling method that deeply analyzes the characteristics of leak signals to identify key points in the reconstruction error curve, thereby determining potential anomalous regions. This approach significantly enhances the interpretability and accuracy of the detection process. Field experiments were conducted on real urban water supply pipelines, and a benchmark dataset was established to evaluate the proposed model and method against commonly used models and methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model and method achieved a high segmentation accuracy of 93.1%. Overall, this study offers a transparent and robust alternative for automated pipeline leak detection, supporting the large-scale, low-cost development of digital twin systems for urban pipeline leak emergency management.
